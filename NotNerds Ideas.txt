*****AR Math Application: #1
Flash cards pop out molecules and have two cards keep on recycling them and its like random order keep on popping out,
so we can do the same with math equations.
We can add a 3d visualization of the function (its just 2d writing floating in space) we can separate functions
with the use of index cards, or cards that people can print out. We can take a step further and when the user
closes in on the equation, it will show the definitions of the parts of the equation such as the coefficients,
powers, etc. We can specialize one of the cards to be a "graph card" that produces a 3D graph of the equation
when connected.
